# :star2: Processing Spirograph :star2:

![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/JamesHarcourt7/processing-spirograph?style=flat-square)

Intended as a solution for Space Cadets Challenge 5 [see challenge 1](https://github.com/JamesHarcourt7/name-scraper), using processing instead of purely java.

[Spirographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph#Mathematical_basis) can create some beautiful and seemingly complex designs. These designs can be summarised in equations (taken from the challenge brief) of the form:

x = (R-r)*cos(t) + O*cos(((R-r)/r)*t)

y = (R-r)*sin(t) - O*sin(((R-r)/r)*t) 

Where R is the radius of the fixed circle, r is the radius of the moving circle and O is the offset of the pen point in the moving circle.

The aim of this project was to learn how to use [processing](https://processing.org/), an open source graphical library I would like to use in future projects. I have not used many graphical libraries apart from pygame, so it is useful to get familiar with another that uses Java. I also thought this would be an entertaining and visually pleasing challenge to attempt.
